# 04 – Passwords and Authentication

Strong authentication protects your digital identity and data from unauthorized access.

### Best Practices for Passwords
- Minimum 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
- Avoid using personal information or common words.  
- Use a **password manager** to store credentials safely.  
- Enable **two-factor authentication (2FA)** whenever possible.

### Secure Authentication
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Simplifies user access across systems.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an additional verification step.  
- **Biometric Authentication:** Uses unique biological traits for security.
