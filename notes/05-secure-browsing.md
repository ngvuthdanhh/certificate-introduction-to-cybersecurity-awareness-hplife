# 05 – Secure Browsing

Browsing safely helps prevent malware infections, phishing, and data theft.

### Safe Browsing Guidelines
- Only visit sites that use **HTTPS**.  
- Avoid entering personal data on public or unknown websites.  
- Keep your browser and extensions updated.  
- Clear cookies and cache regularly.  
- Avoid saving passwords directly in browsers.

### Recognizing Unsafe Sites
- Look for misspelled URLs or fake domain names.  
- Pop-ups asking for credentials are red flags.  
- Check for valid SSL certificates in the address bar.
