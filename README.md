## 📝 Personal Reflection
This program reinforced my understanding of **everyday cybersecurity risks** and the importance of user awareness.  
The lessons emphasized how **human behavior is often the weakest link** — and how structured awareness programs  
can dramatically reduce threats like **phishing, credential theft, and weak password usage**.

It also provided useful insights for designing **cyber hygiene training modules** applicable to both personal  
and organizational contexts.
