# Lab 01: Password Security Practice

## Objective
Understand the importance of strong passwords and practice creating secure ones.

## Steps
1. Review the rules for a strong password:
   - At least 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
   - Avoid dictionary words and personal info
2. Use a password manager (e.g., Bitwarden, KeePassXC) to generate a random password.
3. Evaluate password strength using an offline tool or local entropy calculator.
4. Reflect:
   - How does a longer password improve security?
   - What are the risks of reusing passwords?

## Outcome
You’ll be able to identify weak passwords and create unique, secure ones for each account.
